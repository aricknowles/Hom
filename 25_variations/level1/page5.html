Like Ovid: I’ll have no last words. &nbsp;
This is what it means to die among barbarians. Bar bar bar &nbsp;
was how the Greeks heard our speech — &nbsp;
sheep, beasts — and so we became &nbsp;
barbarians. We make them reveal &nbsp;
the brutes they are, Aleph, by the things &nbsp;
we make them name. David, &nbsp;
they tell me, is the one &nbsp;
one should aspire to, but ever since &nbsp;
I first heard them say Philistine &nbsp;
I’ve known I am Goliath &nbsp;
if I am anything.</p>
